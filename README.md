# Radio

A multi-room synchronized audio player. Remix renders the application inside a Worker, and each
named room is a Celld/Cloudflare-compatible Durable Object with private SQLite state and
hibernatable WebSockets. Audio content lives in the `TRACKS` R2-compatible object binding.

## Local development

Install Node.js 26+ and dependencies, then start Wrangler's local development server:

```sh
npm ci
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
npm run dev
```

Use `npm run dev:celld` for a compatibility run on Celld, serving
<http://127.0.0.1:9876> with disposable local state under `.celld/dev/`. Use the fork revision
pinned in `Dockerfile` for this run and expose `CELLD_VAR_RADIO_PASSWORD` and
`CELLD_VAR_RADIO_SESSION_SECRET`. Production uses the ordinary Celld runtime and public SQLite
bucket configuration described below. The public lobby seeds `cozy` automatically, and
authenticated listeners can create additional persistent rooms.

Client assets are prebuilt into ignored `dist/client/` files because a Worker has no source
filesystem from which `remix/assets` can compile modules on demand.

Useful commands:

```sh
npm run build
npm run dev
npm run dev:celld
npm run types:worker
npm run check
npx remix doctor
```

## Production model

The application image includes Radio and copies `/usr/local/bin/celld` from the digest-pinned
[jackharrhy/celld](https://github.com/jackharrhy/celld) fork in `Dockerfile`. The same runtime
artifact can serve other applications. Pushes to `main` publish the `linux/amd64` image as
`ghcr.io/jackharrhy/radio:main` and a commit tag; deployments should select an immutable digest.

One container prepares the configured backend, runs `celld diagnose`, deploys the Worker and
built assets, then execs Celld. The default `CELLD_BUCKET` is
`sqlite:///app/.celld/object-store/objects.sqlite3`, with replica files under
`CELLD_WATCH=/app/.celld/state`. Persist the entire `/app/.celld` directory and allow the image's
`node` user to write it. The SQLite object store is authoritative: it contains deployments,
Durable Object replication records, and the logical `TRACKS` R2 bucket, including audio bytes.
The room directory, queues, playback state, and track metadata remain in their existing Durable
Object SQLite schemas. Replica files can be rebuilt from the object store.

This backend runs one Radio runtime per local store. It has no host-loss failover or multi-host
shared-disk mode. The fork rejects a second runtime using the same store. The public Worker
listener is `0.0.0.0:44100`; its internal listener stays on loopback. Traefik terminates TLS and
should rate-limit `/join`. Radio owns its shared-password login and signed 30-day session.

Set `CELLD_VAR_RADIO_PASSWORD` and a random 32-character-or-longer
`CELLD_VAR_RADIO_SESSION_SECRET`. When enabling `CELLD_TRUST_FORWARDED_HEADERS=1`, configure
Traefik to replace forwarded host/protocol headers. Only the public listener should be exposed.
The application has no individual accounts or room-level authorization: every holder of the
shared password can see, create, and mutate every room. The upload limit remains **1 GiB**
(1,073,741,824 bytes) per track.

Azure remains available for baseline comparisons and migration. Set `CELLD_BUCKET=az://CONTAINER`
and `AZURE_STORAGE_USE_EMULATOR=true` for Azurite. `AZURITE_BLOB_STORAGE_URL` selects the emulator's
base URL, such as `http://azurite:10000`; startup creates the container with the public emulator
credentials. Set `AZURE_STORAGE_USE_EMULATOR=false` and provide the usual Celld Azure credentials
for a pre-provisioned Azure container. The application and its Worker bindings are identical for
both backends.

Changing `CELLD_BUCKET` does not migrate existing data. Before a backend cutover, stop writers,
keep a recoverable snapshot of the old backend, and use the fork's object-store migration tooling
to copy every object and attribute. Verify room IDs, directory entries, queue/playback state,
track keys, sizes, hashes, and ranged media responses against the source before routing traffic
to the new backend. Preserve the original backend until that comparison passes. For subsequent
SQLite backups, use a consistent SQLite backup or stop the runtime and preserve the database
with its WAL; copying a live main database file alone is insufficient. Never remove
`object-store/` when clearing the replica cache.

## Real Celld verification

Run the production smoke against the exact fork binary used by the image:

```sh
CELLD_BIN=/absolute/path/to/celld npm run test:celld -- --output /tmp/radio-sqlite-smoke.json
CELLD_BIN=/absolute/path/to/celld npm run test:celld -- --upload-bytes 1073741824 --output /tmp/radio-1gib-smoke.json
CELLD_BIN=/absolute/path/to/celld npm run test:celld -- --backend azurite --azurite-url http://127.0.0.1:10000 --allow-azure-suffix-limitation --output /tmp/radio-azurite-smoke.json
```

Install Playwright's Chromium with `npx playwright install chromium` if needed. The test builds
production assets, uses a temporary store and random authentication credentials, creates a room,
uploads a deterministic WAV through the real streaming API, checks browser decoding/playback,
and verifies the complete SHA-256, HEAD, and bounded/suffix byte ranges. It acknowledges queue,
volume, and paused-position changes over an authenticated WebSocket, kills Celld with SIGKILL,
removes its replica directory, restarts through
the production startup script, and verifies the directory, room state, and media again. The
payload defaults to 8 MiB; the explicit 1 GiB run checks the application limit. Failures exit
nonzero and retain the temporary state and runtime log. Use `--keep-state` to retain a successful
run's files. On Linux, the report also records the runtime's peak RSS. Azurite must already be running; each test creates its own uniquely named container.
The Azure adapter currently rejects suffix ranges. The explicit
`--allow-azure-suffix-limitation` flag records that HTTP failure and permits the remaining Azure
checks to run; the result is `passed_with_known_limitations`. SQLite always requires suffix
ranges to pass. These are runtime process-crash checks on the same host, not disk-loss or
host-loss tests.

Before promoting any fork or Radio runtime update, qualify the exact Radio application image
with the full 1 GiB upload under **one CPU and 1 GiB of memory**. The 8 MiB host CI smoke does
not replace this release gate. On a Linux Docker host with cgroup v2, run a locally available
image with swap disabled:

```sh
node scripts/test-celld.mjs --image "$RADIO_IMAGE" --upload-bytes 1073741824 --output /tmp/radio-container-smoke.json
```

The container test uses Docker's host network and a fresh temporary bind mount. It runs as the
invoking host UID/GID so the mount remains writable, inspects the
actual CPU/memory limits, and verifies the killed container's host PID has exited. It records
both Celld's peak RSS and the cgroup memory peak, and requires zero OOM kills. The
image's existing built application and bundled Celld binary are used throughout both starts.

## Room and storage ownership

- `worker.ts` owns only Worker startup and public request dispatch.
- `app/data/worker-radio-runtime.ts` owns Durable Object and object-storage adapters, uploads, and
  ranged media responses.
- `app/data/room-directory-cell.ts` owns the persistent public room directory.
- `app/data/radio-room-cell.ts` owns one room's SQLite state, WebSockets, queue, and playback.
- `app/data/radio-room-store.ts` owns the room's SQLite schema and persistence operations.
- `app/routes.ts` and `app/actions/` own the server-rendered page contract.
- `app/assets/` owns hydrated playback, clock synchronization, and browser audio.
- `test/` owns Worker, Durable Object, R2, alarm, and WebSocket integration tests.
- `dist/client/` is generated and must not be committed.

## Playback synchronization

Clients exchange paired four-timestamp probes with their room cell. The browser keeps a bounded
low-delay sample history, rejects network-delay outliers, and fits a robust offset-and-clock-skew
model. Shared server timestamps are converted to the Web Audio timeline with
`AudioContext.getOutputTimestamp()` when available, with an output-latency fallback otherwise.

The media element streams the track through separate volume and audible-gate gain stages. During
playback, a bounded ±800 ppm rate servo corrects small clock drift; errors of 750 ms or more are
re-anchored by seeking. The `−10ms` and `+10ms` controls persist a per-browser output-device
calibration for latency that the browser cannot measure, such as downstream Bluetooth buffering.

## Inspiration

The synchronization approach, and overall vibes, are derived from [freeman-jiang/beatsync](https://github.com/freeman-jiang/beatsync).
